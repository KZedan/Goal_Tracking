# I can make anything
## I can TDD anything
### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to TDD anything?

The ability to take requirements (user stories) and the behavioural descriptions they provide to guide first the test I write, and then the code I write to pass that test.

To be able to test-drive anything means that I am comfortable and confident to take any problem and follow a structured process so that each test should be the simplest next step, and each piece of code written should be the simplest to pass that test and nothing more. I am guided by the behaviour required via a user-focused feature test and the subsequent, related unit tests.

Following this ```red```, ```green``` and then ```refactor``` cycle ensures clean, minimal and well-designed code, with maximum test coverage.

## Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal
